# DimensionReduction

The report should consist of two main parts: an explanatory part (due Oct. 31) and a results
part. The final report, submitted on Nov. 17, should include both parts together as a single
coherent document that is written in a manner that can be understood by anyone in the class.

The explanatory part should include:
1. Overview/background: Describe the problem and the general area. Summarize what is
known. This section should be similar to the introduction and related work section of a
research paper, providing the reader with the necessary background. This will likely require
you to do some background reading. Depending on your mini-project, it might be relatively
short, or might be 1-2 pages.
2. Algorithms and theory: Describe the basic algorithms. Describe them so clearly that anyone
in the class could implement them. Describe them as you would like them described in your
ideal textbook. Describe them more clearly then that. (Do not just copy the description from
an existing source.) If you can simplify the algorithm to make it easier to understand, do so.

The results part should include:
1. Complete and detailed proofs relating to the algorithm you have described, if such proofs exist
(or if you can come up with them). Obviously, for some heuristics we do not have proofs.
However, if an algorithm can be analyzed, give its analysis. Again, the goal is to present the
analysis more clearly than the clearest textbook you can imagine. Anyone in the class should
be able to read your proof and understand it. (Do not simply claim things to be obviously
true. Do not reference components of the proof elsewhere.)
2. Any optimizations, improvements, or new algorithms or heuristics that you have invented or
experimented with.
3. Implementation and experiments: Describe any implementations. Present any data that you
have collected and analyze it. (Your analysis of the experiments/data should explain the
implications of what you have done.)
4. Conclusion: State any conclusions, and describe any hypotheses/conjectures that have arisen
from your analysis/experiments. Give a few interesting questions that have come up during
your exploration. Describe some possible further applications of these techniques.
The nal report should be completely self-contained and easy to read. Each section should read
as a well-written stand-alone section, beginning with an introductory paragraph and continuing
with a sequential development of subsections. Good writing is encouraged throughout.
